This program allows you to change direction of slashes using global hotkeys. 

## Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/Fiend3d/REClipboard
npm install 
npm run package-win
```
or just
```
npm test
```
It might also work with 
```
npm run package-linux
```
but I didn't try it yet. 

I made this project because I wanted to try Electron.
