# ![RECLibboard](assets/icon_black_small.png) RegEx Clipboard
This program allows you to change direction of slashes using global hotkeys which saves a lot of time if you work on windows. 
```cpp
"C:\Program Files\CMake" -> "C:/Program Files/CMake"
```
You can add any other expression you need. 

## Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/Fiend3d/REClipboard
npm install 
npm run package-win
```
or just
```
npm test
```
It might also work with 
```
npm run package-linux
```
but I didn't try it yet. 

I made this project because I wanted to try Electron.
